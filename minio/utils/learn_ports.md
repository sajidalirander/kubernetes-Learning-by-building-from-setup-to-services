## The Journey of a Request
In [MinIO Service](../config/minio-service.yaml), We have: 
```yaml
ports: 
    - port: 9090 
      targetPort: 9090 
      nodePort: 30627 
```
We will discuss the following questions: 
> * What is difference between `port` and `targetPort`?
> * Is it recommended or mandatory to use same port `9090` for `port` and `targetPort`?
> * What is this syntax `9090:30627/TCP` and how to interpret it? 

That's a fantastic questions. Isn't it? It gets to the heart of how `Services` work.

## Responses of the Request
It is important to understand the traffic flow at this point. Let's visualize it together.

> What is difference between `port` and `targetPort`?

Think of it like a phone system for an office:
* You (from your browser): You dial the public number for the office, which is your server's IP address, followed by the extension `30627`. For example: `http://<your-server-ip>:30627`.
* The Node (the building's receptionist): The Kubernetes node is listening on port `30627`. It receives your call and knows this extension belongs to the `minio-service`.
* The Service (the office switchboard): The minio-service takes the call. Its own internal extension is 9090 (the port). It then looks up which pod to forward the call to.
* The Pod (the employee's desk): The service forwards the call to the MinIO pod's own phone, which is listening on port 9090 (the targetPort).

Let's use our office phone system analogy to see the difference between them.
* `targetPort`: This is the actual port your application container is listening on. Think of it as the employee's direct phone extension at their desk `(9090)`. This is defined by the application software (MinIO in this case).
* `port`: This is the internal extension that the `Service` (the office switchboard) uses.

>  Is it recommended or mandatory to use same port `9090` for `port` and `targetPort`?

In short, tt's recommended for clarity, but it is not mandatory. They can be different.

You could have a situation where the service's internal extension is `80`, but it forwards the call to the employee's desk at extension `9090`. In YAML, that would look like: `port: 80 targetPort: 9090`. So, why would you want to do this? 

It's useful for avoiding port conflicts. Imagine you have two different applications that are both hard-coded to listen on port `9090`. You could expose them with two different services, one using `port: 9090` and the other using `port: 9091`, but both would have a `targetPort: 9090`.

So, keeping them the same is good practice because it's less confusing, but the flexibility is there when you need it.

> What is this syntax `9090:30627/TCP` and how to interpret it? 

You've got all the pieces. The syntax simply encodes that flow:
* `9090`: This is the port the Service exposes inside the cluster.
* `30627`: This is the port the Node exposes to the outside world.
* `/TCP`: This is the network protocol being used.
