## File Naming (- vs _ )
It's a common convention in the Kubernetes and broader DevOps world to use a `hyphen (-)` for file names, like `minio-secret.yaml`.

While an `underscore (_)` will often work, hyphens are generally safer and more universally compatible with various command-line tools and programming languages. Sticking with hyphens is a good professional habit to build.
