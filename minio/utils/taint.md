## Decode the error
Let's look at the key message: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint `{node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: }`.

This is Kubernetes's way of telling us about a safety feature. By default, the control-plane node has a `taint` on it.

## Understanding Kubernetes Taints
The system of Taints and Tolerations is how Kubernetes ensures that pods are only scheduled on appropriate nodes.

### Taints: The "No Trespassing" Sign
A Taint is a property you place on a node. It acts as a "repellent" to prevent pods from being scheduled there. Taints have three main effects:
* `NoSchedule`: No new pods will be scheduled on the node unless they have a matching toleration. (This is the one you encountered).
* `PreferNoSchedule`: The system will try to avoid placing pods on this node, but it's not a strict rule.
* `NoExecute`: This is the strongest. It will evict any pods that are already running on the node if they don't have a matching toleration.

### Tolerations: The "Permission Slip"
A Toleration is a property you place on a pod. It's like a special permission slip that allows a pod to be scheduled on a node with a matching taint.

The control-plane pods you saw earlier (etcd, kube-apiserver, etc.) all have a toleration built-in for that control-plane taint. That's why they were allowed to run on `sajid` node from the beginning. Our MinIO pod, however, didn't have this permission slip, so it was rejected.

So, you can see we had two ways to solve our problem:
* Remove the Taint from the node (the method we are going to use). This is like taking down the "No Trespassing" sign so anyone can enter.
* Add a Toleration to our MinIO pod's YAML. This would have been like giving our pod the special permission slip to enter the restricted area.

## Remove the Taint from node
A `taint` is like a "No Trespassing" sign that prevents normal application pods from being scheduled there. This protects the important control-plane components from being overwhelmed by user applications.

So, the scheduler is saying, "I can't place your MinIO pod here because this node is reserved for control-plane duties."

In our small, single-node cluster, the control-plane node can pull double duty. We just need to give it permission to run regular workloads. We can do this by removing the "No Trespassing" signâ€”the taint. The command to do that is `kubectl taint nodes`. 

Given that, and the taint information from the error message, how would you construct the full command to remove that specific taint from `sajid` node?

A taint has three parts: the key, the value, and the effect. The error message from kubectl describe gives us the whole thing:
```bash
node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule
```
Here, `NoSchedule` is the effect. It's what tells the scheduler not to place pods there.

With this information, the full format of the command is:
```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <taint-key>:<taint-effect>-
```
The `minus` sign at the very end is the key to removing the taint. Therefore, 
```bash
kubectl taint nodes sajid node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
```
Let's break it down:
* `kubectl taint nodes sajid`: "I want to change the taints on the node named sajid."
* `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane`: This is the key of the taint.
* `:NoSchedule`: This is the effect of the taint.
* `-`: This final minus sign is what tells the command to remove the taint.


Go ahead and run that command. Once it's done, check the status of your pods again with `kubectl get pods`. The scheduler should now be able to place your MinIO pod on the node.

## Case study

```bash
sajid@sajid:~$ kubectl taint nodes sajid node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule- 
node/sajid untainted 
sajid@sajid:~$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE 
minio-deployment-69849b9879-42cg6   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          25m
```

The `node/sajid untainted` message confirms you've successfully removed the "No Trespassing" sign, and the pod's status immediately changed from `Pending` to `ContainerCreating`.

`ContainerCreating` means the scheduler has placed the pod on your node, and now your node is in the process of downloading the `minio/minio` image and starting the container. This can take a minute or two.

Run `kubectl get pods` again in a little while. What's the final STATUS you expect to see when it's ready?

```bash
sajid@sajid:~$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE 
minio-deployment-69849b9879-42cg6   1/1     Running   0          36m
```

That's a wrap. Your MinIO pod is now officially running.
