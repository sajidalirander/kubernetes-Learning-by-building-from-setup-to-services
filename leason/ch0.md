## Cluster v/s Node
At this point, some clarification is needed before going to further. I want you to know the difference between cluster and nodes.

Think of a cluster not as a single PC, but as a team of players working together. It's the entire Kubernetes environment, working as one coordinated system.

A node is an individual player on that team. It's a single machineâ€”which could be a physical server in a data center or a virtual machine (like the one you're using). Every node contributes its own resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to the cluster's total power.

> Based on that, does a Kubernetes cluster need to have more than one node to work?

A cluster can indeed be a "team of one." In fact, the setup you just created is a perfect example: it's a fully functional, single-node cluster where the one node acts as both the manager (the control plane) and the worker. This is very common for learning, development, and testing.

In a multi-node cluster, we have different roles. Some nodes are control-plane nodes (the managers) and some are worker nodes (the players).

Let's dive into the node and learn more.
