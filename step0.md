We'll need to check three main things:

Operating System (OS)
CPU Cores
RAM (Memory)
Let's start by gathering that information from your server. Could you run the commands below in your terminal and share the output?

```bash
# To check your Linux distribution and version
cat /etc/os-release

# To check the number of CPU cores
nproc

# To check the amount of available RAM (in human-readable format)
free -h
```
